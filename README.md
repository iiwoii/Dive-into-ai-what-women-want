Below are the steps for women without a tech background to learn AI. 

While there are many excellent GitHub projects available for everyone to study AI, this particular one aims to address the psychological barriers that women often face when learning math, programming, and other technical subjects.


And remember, if you don't understand something, it's not that you don't understand well; it means that I don't explain it well enough:)

So, our plan is as follows:

1. We study Python
2. We read the most asked interview questions (just read)
3. We study Generative AI
4. We read the most asked interview questions (still just read)
5. We study Probability and Statistics
6. We answer the most asked Python interview questions
7. We study Math and Optimization
8. We answer the most asked Generative AI interview questions (at this point we just memorize the answers)
9. We study ML
10. We answer the most asked Probability and Statistics interview questions
11. We study Algorithms
12. We answer the most asked Math and Optimization interview questions
13. We study DL
14. We answer the most asked ML interview questions
15. We study CV, NLP, RL
16. We answer the most asked Algorithms interview questions
17. We study Generative AI, at this time with a lot of details
18. We answer the most asked  DL interview questions
19. We study Cloud Computing
20. We answer the most asked CV, NLP, RL interview questions
21. We study AI and Big Data details
22. We answer the most asked Generative AI interview questions
23. We study Time Series analysis

26. We answer the most asked Time Series analysis interview questions
27. We study the most actual AI reports to understand the most recent trends
28. We study Risk Management in AI, Cybersecurity in AI, Ethics and Regulation/Legal issues in AI
29. We study to work with the papers and projects with the code to follow the logics of the most popular authors to get the practical skills by repeating the idea implementations.
30. We answer the wide list of the most asked interview questions.
